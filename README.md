FTS UI Kit
====================

FTS UI Kit consistently styles markup elements across all browsers, as far back as IE8, by incorporating Normalize.css from the start and adding a light coating of styling and additional pre-sets on top of it.

## Tinker Away

If you want to start poking around the source files and customizing your build of FTS UI Kit, you'll need to download or clone the FTS UI Kit repo.

You can then either modify the uncompressed FTS UI Kit CSS files, or if you are comfortable with Sass, you can modify the source files.

If you need to install Sass on your machine, you can read how to do that here: http://sass-lang.com/install

Compiling the Sass then only requires you to command line into the parent UI Kit folder and run
```sass --watch stylesheets```
to compile the Sass into the CSS.
